<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=2 data-line-end=3><a id="Welcome_2"></a>Welcome</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">Thank you for considering becoming a peer teacher (PT) for the First-Year Program in Engineering. The purpose of this page is to provide you with some information about what the expectations are for PTs, and to try to answer some frequently asked questions. If you have a question which isn’t answered here, please email Dr. Cahill at tcahill@tamu.edu. (If you ask a question which is answered here, Dr. Cahill will either direct you back here or ignore you, depending on how much coffee he has had that day. <em>So read the whole thing</em>…)</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">One important rule - you cannot be a PT for a class you have not yet passed. For example, if you are rising sophomore and haven’t passed 217 yet, don’t sign up for a slot in 217.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=7 data-line-end=8><a id="ENGR_102_7"></a>ENGR 102</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">In ENGR 102 peer teachers attend each of the 2 two-hour meetings per week for the section for which they work. As you may recall, in 102 there is about 1 hour of lecture per week. The remaining three hours per week are used as an in-class programming lab. During this time you should be walking around the classroom, helping the students as directed by the instructor.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">ENGR 102 PTs also hold office hours and grade assignments outside of the class meeting time. They are also expected to attend occasional meetings with the instructor/course director.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">A PT can submit 7 work hours per week for each slot of ENGR 102 for which he/she has signed up (4 hours in class + 1 hour office hours + 2 hours grading). You can sign up for a maximum of 2 102 slots.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=14 data-line-end=15><a id="ENGRPHYS_216__217_lecture_PTs_14"></a>ENGR/PHYS 216 &amp; 217 lecture PTs</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="16">In ENGR/PHYS 216 and 217 lecture PTs attend the lectures every week. They also grade HW for the sections for which they have signed up for. Typically an instructor will have a GAT (graduate teaching assistant) who will coordinate which PT grades which assignment in which week. Lecture PTs also hold weekly office hours, and are also expected to attend occasional meetings with the course directors.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="17" data-line-end="18">A lecture PT can submit 3.5 work hours per week for each slot of ENGR/PHYS 216/217 for which he/she has signed up (1 hour in class + 1 hour of office hours + 1.5 hours grading). You can sign up for a maximum of 4 lecture PT slots.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=19 data-line-end=20><a id="ENGRPHYS_216__217_lab_PTs_19"></a>ENGR/PHYS 216 &amp; 217 lab PTs</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="20" data-line-end="22"><em>There are some important differences in how lab PTs work, so please read carefully</em><br>
In ENGR/PHYS 216 and 217 lab PTs work in the lab during the time slot(s) for which they have signed up helping the students with their lab work. Lab PTs do <strong>not</strong> hold office hours. Lab PTs do grade the lab reports. There will be a GAT who will coordinate what lab reports you grade.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="23" data-line-end="24">While each lab is 3 hours, we realize it is hard for most students to free up a block of 3 hours. The 3 hours is therefore split into two 1.5 hour slots. For each lab slot a lab PT can submit 3.5 hours per week (1.5 hour in class + 2 hours grading.) There will be occasional meetings of the lab PTs with the lab directors.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="26">This fall term, each section will have lab only every other week (week 1 or week 2 of a cycle.) If you sign up for a lab slot, therefore, you will only be working in the lab every other week. Because of this, you can sign up for up to 8 lab PT slots.</p>
