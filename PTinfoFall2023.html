<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=2 data-line-end=3><a id="Welcome_2"></a>Welcome</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">Thank you for considering becoming a peer teacher (PT) for the First-Year Program in Engineering. The purpose of this page is to provide you with some information about what the expectations are for PTs, and to try to answer some frequently asked questions. If you have a question which isn’t answered here, please email Dr. Cahill at tcahill@tamu.edu. (If you ask a question which is answered here, Dr. Cahill will either direct you back here or ignore you, depending on how much coffee he has had that day. <em>So read the whole thing</em>…)</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">One important rule - you cannot be a PT for a class you have not yet passed. For example, if you are rising sophomore and haven’t passed 217 yet, don’t sign up for a slot in 217.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=7 data-line-end=8><a id="ENGR_102_7"></a>ENGR 102</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">In ENGR 102 peer teachers attend each of the 2 two-hour meetings per week for the section for which they work. As you may recall, in 102 there is about 1 hour of lecture per week. The remaining three hours per week are used as an in-class programming lab. During this time you should be walking around the classroom, helping the students as directed by the instructor.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">ENGR 102 PTs also hold office hours and grade assignments outside of the class meeting time. They are also expected to attend occasional meetings with the instructor/course director.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">A PT can submit up to 7 work hours per week for each slot of ENGR 102 for which he/she has signed up (4 hours in class + 1 hour office hours + 2 hours grading). You can sign up for a maximum of 2 102 slots.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=14 data-line-end=15><a id="ENGRPHYS_216__217_lecture_PTs_14"></a>ENGR/PHYS 216 &amp; 217 lecture PTs</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="16">In ENGR/PHYS 216 and 217 lecture PTs attend the lectures every week. They also grade HW for the sections for which they have signed up for. Typically an instructor will have a GAT (graduate teaching assistant) who will coordinate which PT grades which assignment in which week. Lecture PTs also hold weekly office hours, and are also expected to attend occasional meetings with the course directors.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="17" data-line-end="18">A lecture PT can submit 3.5 work hours per week for each slot of ENGR/PHYS 216/217 for which he/she has signed up (1 hour in class + 1 hour of office hours + 1.5 hours grading).</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=19 data-line-end=20><a id="ENGRPHYS_216__217_lab_PTs_19"></a>ENGR/PHYS 216 &amp; 217 lab PTs</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="20" data-line-end="22"><br>
In ENGR/PHYS 216 and 217 lab PTs work in the lab during the time slot(s) for which they have signed up helping the students with their lab work. Both Lab and Lecture PTs will hold office hours (this is a change from last year.) Lab PTs do grade the lab reports. There will be a GAT who will coordinate what lab reports you grade.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="23" data-line-end="24">While each lab is 3 hours, we realize it is hard for most students to free up a block of 3 hours. The 3 hours is therefore split into two 1.5 hour slots. For each lab slot a lab PT can submit 3.5 hours per week (1.5 hour in class + 2 hours for grading & office hour.) There will be occasional meetings of the lab PTs with the lab directors.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="26">Each lab slot will interact with two sections - one on week 1 of a lab cycle, one on week 2 of the cycle. For some slots one week is with 216 and one week is with 217.  Do not sign up for one of these slots if you don't feel able to do both courses.</p>

<p>You can sign up for a maximum of 4 lab/lecture PT slots.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="28" data-line-end="30">Q: How much do I get paid?<br>
A: The current pay rate for PTs is $11.50 per hour. This may change once we have the budget for next year.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="31" data-line-end="33">Q: How do I get paid?<br>
A: You will submit your time through Workday. Pay will be direct-deposited.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="31" data-line-end="33">Q: This is great!  I'm going to sign up for all the slots I can!<br>
A: Not so fast. This is not our first rodeo, and we've seen plenty of students sign up for too many slots, and then have drop them in August, or even worse ghost us.  Think carefully about how much time you can commit to this job.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="34" data-line-end="36">Q: How do I see what slots are available?<br>
A: You can see what slots are open</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="47" data-line-end="36">Q: I don't see any slots I like. Will more open up?<br>
A: Yes, more slots will open as registration continues through the summer. Keep checking.</p>
<p>Q: What happens next? When can I start bossing the fish around?<br>
A: Slow down, hoss. First we'll need to get some more information from you. Then you'll have to fill out some online forms for Payroll. Then there's a background check. Just watch your inbox for emails letting you know what to do.</p>
<p>Q: I'm nervous about my ability to do the job.  Will you train me?<br>
A: Absolutely. We know PTs need to learn how to be good PTs (and good PTs need to learn how to be better PTs.)</p>
<p>Q: I know my schedule will change before the fall, because I will be entering a major.  Can I still sign up?<br>
A: Yes. We understand that students' schedules change. If you have to drop a section for which you signed up because you need to take a class, that's ok.</p>
