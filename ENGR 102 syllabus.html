<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">Introduction to the design and development of computer applications for engineers; computation to enhance problem solving abilities; basic concepts of software design through the implementation and debugging of student-written programs; introduction to engineering majors, career exploration, engineering practice within realistic constraints, e.g. economic, environmental, ethical, health and safety, and sustainability; pathways to success in engineering.</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=8 data-line-end=9><a id="Prerequisites_8"></a>Prerequisites</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">C or better in MATH 151 or concurrent enrollment; admission to the College of Engineering.</p>
<h4 class="code-line" data-line-start=11 data-line-end=12><a id="What_is_this_course_about_11"></a>What is this course about?</h4>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">This course provides an introduction into the design and development of computer applications for engineers. <strong>No prior experience in programming is necessary</strong>. Students will learn to use computation to enhance their problem solving abilities. The course will cover basic concepts of software design through the implementation and debugging of student-written programs.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">Because first-year engineers at TAMU need to decide which major they want to join, this course also introduces engineering majors that are available to students, types of work engineers in their field do, engineering practice within realistic constraints, e.g. economic, environmental, ethical, health and safety, and sustainability, and the paths to success in their chosen field.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="17">The language used in this course is Python 3. Your instructor will provide information on which version to use, which IDE to use, and how to install everything.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="18" data-line-end="19">The class meets twice a week, and each session is 2 hours. Typically there is a one hour of lecture, and the remaining three hours are spent working on programs. The instructor and student peer teachers are more than happy to help you through programming roadblocks in these three hours (that’s what we’re paid to do!)</p>

<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="40" data-line-end="41">Exam 1 (15%) – 1 hour midterm exam</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="41" data-line-end="42">Exam 2 (20%) – 1 hour comprehensive second exam</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="42" data-line-end="45">Classwork &amp; Homework (54%) – You will have a variety of assignments throughout the term. Lab assignments will be assigned weekly and are designed to help students understand the course material, provide practical programming experience, and help improve problem-solving abilities. Labs will consist of both in-class activities and take-home assignments. While many assignments will be individual, some lab assignments will be done in teams. A team project will be due at the end of the semester; details on this project will be provided later in the term.<br>
• Department Module Homework assignments (8%) – Students must complete the assignments having to do with the introduction of the engineering disciplines &amp; engineering practice, as well as the modules addressing student success.<br>
• Industry Night Essay and DI Saturday Essays (3%) - You will be required to attend 1 Industry Night Online Seminar during the term. These are informational events featuring different companies that hire engineering graduates. Information on dates and companies will be forthcoming. You will need to view two online presentations for DI Saturday. For all of these events you will need to submit a short (250 word) essay indicated you attended and paid attention. More details on Industry Nights and DI Saturday will be forthcoming.</li>
